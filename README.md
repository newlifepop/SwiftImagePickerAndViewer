# SwiftImagePickerAndViewer
This image picker written in Swift is not a module, it is for educational purpose. (I encourage everyone to use as little third party libraries as you can, if other people can write it, so can you). If this happens to be something you're looking for, simply copy-paste the code and customize it with your own purpose. I will try to do everything programmatically so it's easier for both of us. This small project supports:

1. Multiple photos selection

2. Single video/GIF image selection (Same as Twitter)

3. Disable assets that shouldn't be selected (e.g. Request only still images, then disable all videos to prevent selection)

4. Tap to view image in full screen mode with animation
